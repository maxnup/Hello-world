# Hello-world
Getting ready for something big

So here I am. I returned to learn about data science because of the coronavirus. I'm learning how to do analytics in Python with pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, bokeh, scikit-learn and other differents libraries. I hope to make something great when I will have be able to manage most data science tools. Let's go!
